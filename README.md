levels cannot describe on how much i yell at (affectionately.. most the time) and love my real life friends

before you interacts i must let you know that i might be dry at first, and once i get comfortable i take a minute to process things have have the slowest responses on earth (possibly)

but when im comfortable i say whatever comes to my mind
